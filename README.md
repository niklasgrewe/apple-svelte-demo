# Apple Svelte Demo

This directory is a short example for an apple like zoom-out animation only created with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
The purpose of this project is to show how easy it is to create complex animations without using frameworks like ScrollMagic or GSAP
